### PM Phase 2: Project Planning

In this phase, the project is meticulously planned to ensure efficient progress and timely completion. Key tasks in Project Planning include:

1. **Describing Project Scope, Alternatives, and Feasibility**  
   - Define what the project aims to achieve, explore alternative approaches, and assess if the project is viable within constraints.

2. **Dividing the Project into Manageable Tasks**  
   - Break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks for better tracking and assignment.

3. **Estimating Resources and Creating a Resource Plan**  
   - Determine the resources needed (e.g., manpower, materials, technology) and develop a plan for resource allocation.

4. **Developing a Preliminary Schedule**  
   - Outline a preliminary timeline that allocates tasks to specific dates to create a working schedule.

5. **Developing a Communication Plan**  
   - Set up a communication strategy to ensure clear and regular updates between the project team and stakeholders.

6. **Determining Project Standards and Procedures**  
   - Establish standards for quality, documentation, and work procedures to maintain consistency and efficiency.

7. **Identifying and Assessing Risk**  
   - Identify potential risks that could impact the project and evaluate their likelihood and possible impact.

8. **Creating a Preliminary Budget**  
   - Draft an initial budget, estimating costs for resources, labor, and other project requirements.

9. **Developing a Project Scope Statement**  
   - Document the projectâ€™s scope to outline what is included and excluded, providing a clear understanding for all parties.

10. **Setting a Baseline Project Plan**  
   - Finalize a baseline plan that serves as a reference for monitoring project progress and comparing actual vs. planned performance.

Each of these tasks contributes to a well-structured foundation for the project, allowing the team to proceed with a clear, organized, and achievable path forward.
