### Phase 2: Project Planning

- **Objective**: Create a detailed roadmap for the project, covering the scope, resources, timeline, and standards to guide the team throughout execution.

- **Key Steps**:

  1. **Describing Project Scope, Alternatives, and Feasibility**: 
     - Define what the project will deliver, potential alternatives, and assess feasibility to ensure it meets objectives.

  2. **Dividing the Project into Manageable Tasks**: 
     - Break down the project into smaller, clear tasks for easier tracking and management.

  3. **Estimating Resources and Creating a Resource Plan**: 
     - Determine the necessary resources (e.g., personnel, equipment) and allocate them effectively.

  4. **Developing a Preliminary Schedule**: 
     - Outline a timeline with key milestones, estimated completion dates, and dependencies.

  5. **Developing a Communication Plan**: 
     - Define how information will be shared within the team and with stakeholders.

  6. **Determining Project Standards and Procedures**: 
     - Establish standards and guidelines for quality, coding, documentation, and reporting.

  7. **Identifying and Assessing Risk**: 
     - List potential risks, assess their likelihood and impact, and create strategies to mitigate them.

  8. **Creating a Preliminary Budget**: 
     - Estimate costs associated with the project, including resources, materials, and contingency funds.

  9. **Developing a Project Scope Statement**: 
     - Write a formal document detailing the project's deliverables, objectives, and boundaries.

  10. **Setting a Baseline Project Plan**: 
     - Finalize the initial plan, which serves as the benchmark for tracking project progress.

This phase sets a clear direction for the project, ensuring that all aspects, from scope to budgeting, are well-defined and ready for implementation.


**Phase 2: Project Planning** for a **Mobile Banking App Development Project**:

### Example: Mobile Banking App Development Project

- **Objective**: Develop a secure and user-friendly mobile app for a bank, allowing customers to check balances, make transfers, and pay bills.

- **Key Steps**:

  1. **Describing Project Scope, Alternatives, and Feasibility**: 
     - **Scope**: App features include account balance, transfers, bill pay, and push notifications.
     - **Alternatives**: Evaluate whether to use in-house development or outsource part of the work.
     - **Feasibility**: Ensure budget, timeframe, and team expertise align with the project needs.

  2. **Dividing the Project into Manageable Tasks**: 
     - Divide the project into tasks like UI/UX design, backend development, security testing, user testing, and app store deployment.

  3. **Estimating Resources and Creating a Resource Plan**: 
     - Resources needed include mobile developers, UI/UX designers, QA testers, and cybersecurity specialists.

  4. **Developing a Preliminary Schedule**: 
     - Schedule includes key milestones: design completion (1 month), development (4 months), testing (2 months), and final deployment.

  5. **Developing a Communication Plan**: 
     - Weekly project meetings with the team, monthly updates to stakeholders, and real-time communication via Slack.

  6. **Determining Project Standards and Procedures**: 
     - Set coding standards, design guidelines, testing procedures, and documentation protocols to ensure quality and consistency.

  7. **Identifying and Assessing Risk**: 
     - Identify potential risks: data security breaches, delays in testing, and app store rejections. Develop contingency plans, like extra testing for security.

  8. **Creating a Preliminary Budget**: 
     - Estimate costs for development resources, testing tools, security audits, and a 10% contingency fund for unforeseen expenses.

  9. **Developing a Project Scope Statement**: 
     - Document that includes the appâ€™s core features, objectives (improving customer experience), and scope boundaries.

  10. **Setting a Baseline Project Plan**: 
     - Approve and finalize the initial plan, with clear timelines, task ownership, and metrics to monitor progress.

This example shows how **Phase 2: Project Planning** provides a structured roadmap, detailing every essential aspect from resources to risk management, setting the project up for a successful execution phase.
