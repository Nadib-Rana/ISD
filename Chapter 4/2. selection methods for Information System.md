### Characteristics of Alternative Methods for Making Information Systems Identification and Selection Decisions

| **Selection Method**         | **Characteristics**                                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Top Management**           | - Greater strategic focus<br>- Largest project size<br>- Longest project duration<br>- Enterprise-wide consideration |
| **Steering Committee**       | - Cross-functional focus<br>- Greater organizational change<br>- Formal cost-benefit analysis<br>- Larger and riskier projects |
| **Functional Area**          | - Narrow, nonstrategic focus<br>- Faster development<br>- Fewer users, management layers, and business functions involved |
| **Development Group**        | - Integration with existing systems focus<br>- Fewer development delays<br>- Less concern with cost-benefit analysis |

### Explanation of Selection Methods

1. **Top Management**:
   - This method emphasizes a strategic approach, often involving large-scale projects that require significant resources and time. It is suitable for initiatives that affect the entire organization and align with high-level business goals.

2. **Steering Committee**:
   - This approach includes representatives from various functions, ensuring that different perspectives are considered. It aims for comprehensive project evaluations and is better for large and potentially riskier projects, often backed by formal cost-benefit analyses.

3. **Functional Area**:
   - Here, the focus is more localized, targeting specific departmental needs rather than broader strategic goals. Projects can be developed more quickly due to fewer stakeholders and less bureaucracy, making it suitable for urgent requirements.

4. **Development Group**:
   - This method is highly practical, emphasizing seamless integration with existing systems. It minimizes development delays by focusing on specific technical aspects, though it may lack extensive cost-benefit evaluations.

### Conclusion
Each selection method has its advantages and limitations, making it essential for organizations to choose the one that aligns with their strategic objectives, resource capabilities, and project needs. By understanding these characteristics, organizations can make informed decisions about which IS development projects to pursue.
