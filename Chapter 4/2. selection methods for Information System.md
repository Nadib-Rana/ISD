### Selection Methods

1. **Top Management**:
   - **Focus**: Strategic initiatives that impact the whole organization.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - Involves large projects needing significant resources and time.
     - Aligns with high-level business goals.
   - **Example**: A bank decides to implement a new core banking system that will streamline operations across all branches. This project is approved by top management because it aligns with the bank's goal of improving efficiency and customer service.

2. **Steering Committee**:
   - **Focus**: Diverse perspectives from various functions.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Ensures comprehensive project evaluations.
     - Suitable for large, risky projects with formal cost-benefit analyses.
   - **Example**: A healthcare organization forms a steering committee to evaluate the development of an electronic health record (EHR) system. The committee includes representatives from IT, finance, and clinical departments to ensure all aspects are considered, leading to a well-rounded decision.

3. **Functional Area**:
   - **Focus**: Specific departmental needs.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Faster project development due to fewer stakeholders.
     - Best for urgent requirements.
   - **Example**: The marketing department of a retail company needs a new customer relationship management (CRM) tool to quickly manage leads and sales data. They decide to select a CRM system that can be implemented within weeks, bypassing broader company reviews due to its urgent need.

4. **Development Group**:
   - **Focus**: Practical integration with existing systems.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Minimizes development delays.
     - Less emphasis on extensive cost-benefit evaluations.
   - **Example**: A software development team is tasked with creating a new feature for an existing project management tool. They focus on seamlessly integrating the feature without lengthy formal evaluations since it builds on current capabilities and addresses user feedback quickly.
