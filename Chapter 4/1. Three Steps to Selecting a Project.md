Hereâ€™s a simple outline with an example for these three steps:

### Three Steps to Selecting a Project

1. **Identify Potential Projects**:
   - Brainstorm various project ideas based on organizational goals, customer needs, or market demands.

   **Example**: A software company identifies three potential projects: (1) a mobile banking app, (2) an e-commerce website for small businesses, and (3) an AI-powered customer support chatbot.

2. **Evaluate Project Feasibility**:
   - Assess the feasibility of each project by considering factors such as budget, time, resource availability, and potential risks.

   **Example**: The company reviews each project:
     - **Mobile Banking App**: High demand but requires extensive security and compliance work.
     - **E-commerce Website**: Moderate demand, manageable resources, and shorter development time.
     - **Customer Support Chatbot**: Innovative but requires specialized AI expertise, which may increase costs and timeline.

3. **Select the Most Viable Project**:
   - Based on the feasibility analysis, select the project with the best balance of value, feasibility, and alignment with company goals.

   **Example**: The company selects the **E-commerce Website for Small Businesses** as the most viable project, given its reasonable demand, shorter timeline, and lower resource needs, making it both feasible and valuable.
