### The Process of Identifying and Selecting IS Development Projects

#### Criteria for Evaluation üìã
When selecting IS development projects, consider the following criteria:

1. **Requirements**:
   - Real-time data entry
   - Automatic reorder functionality
   - Real-time data query capabilities

2. **Constraints**:
   - Developer costs
   - Hardware costs
   - Operating costs
   - Ease of training for users

#### Weighted Multicriteria Analysis ‚öñÔ∏è
To rank alternative projects effectively, you can use a weighted multicriteria analysis approach. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Assign Weights**: Assign a weight to each criterion based on its importance to the project goals (e.g., a total weight of 100).
2. **Rate Alternatives**: Rate each alternative project based on how well it meets each criterion (e.g., a score from 1 to 5, where 5 is the best).
3. **Calculate Scores**: Multiply the rating for each criterion by its weight and sum the scores for each alternative.

#### Example Table

| Criteria              | Weight | Alternative A | Score | Alternative B | Score | Alternative C | Score |
|-----------------------|--------|---------------|-------|---------------|-------|---------------|-------|
| Real-time data entry  | 50     | 5             | 250   | 4             | 200   | 3             | 150   |
| Automatic reorder      | 25     | 5             | 125   | 3             | 75    | 4             | 100   |
| Real-time data query   | 25     | 5             | 125   | 3             | 75    | 5             | 125   |
| **Total**              | **100**|               | **500**|               | **350**|               | **375**|

#### Interpretation of Results
- **Alternative A**: Total score of **500** (best option based on criteria)
- **Alternative C**: Total score of **375**
- **Alternative B**: Total score of **350**

### Conclusion
Using a weighted multicriteria analysis allows organizations to evaluate potential IS development projects systematically. By considering the importance of each criterion, this method helps in selecting the most viable project that aligns with business goals and constraints.
