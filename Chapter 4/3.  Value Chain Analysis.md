### Classifying and Ranking IS Development Projects

#### What is Value Chain Analysis?
Value Chain Analysis helps organizations understand how their activities add value to products and services. It also identifies costs associated with these activities. This analysis can help find ways to improve operations and performance.

#### Steps in Value Chain Analysis:

1. **Identify Key Activities**:
   - Break down operations into **Primary Activities** (e.g., production, marketing, sales) and **Support Activities** (e.g., IT, HR).

2. **Assess Value Addition**:
   - Determine how each activity contributes to the overall value. Identify which activities give a competitive advantage.

3. **Analyze Costs**:
   - Examine the costs of each activity. Look for ways to reduce costs without affecting quality.

4. **Benchmark Against Competitors**:
   - Compare your activities and costs with those of competitors to find areas for improvement.

5. **Prioritize Projects**:
   - Classify IS development projects based on their potential to enhance value or lower costs.
   - Focus on projects that improve key activities first.

#### Example of Classifying and Ranking IS Projects:

- **Project A**: New inventory management system (improves supply chain).
- **Project B**: CRM system (enhances customer relationships).
- **Project C**: IT infrastructure upgrade (supports technology).

**Ranking Based on Value Chain Analysis**:
1. **Project B** (CRM system) - Best for increasing sales and customer satisfaction.
2. **Project A** (Inventory Management) - Helps cut costs and improve efficiency.
3. **Project C** (IT Upgrade) - Important but has less immediate impact on sales.

### Conclusion
Value Chain Analysis is a useful tool for deciding which IS projects to focus on. By looking at how activities add value and comparing costs, organizations can prioritize projects that support their goals and improve overall performance.
